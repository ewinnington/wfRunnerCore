# wfRunnerCore
Building a minimum CoreWf workflow runner that supports dynamic loading of dlls with activities. Includes a basic set of Extensions (Logger, Email Server address) and an activity DLL with Email, Zip and RunCommand demonstration. Uses [dmetzgar/CoreWf](https://github.com/dmetzgar/corewf) as a submodule. 

This runner is developed to test the features of [CoreWf](https://github.com/dmetzgar/corewf) and discover the differences in behaviors between Workflow-Foundation on the .Net Framework and CoreWf on .net core.
